# Yisy AI Framework



Welcome to my AI Framework project. I am new to ML/DL and I want to learn step by step how frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch work, by developing this project. That also means, this framework is not supposed to have a high efficiency like other professional frameworks. All of these are just for learning and fun. 

 The current version contains only the following functions:

- Network
  - Sequential
- Layer
  - Dense
- Activation Function
  - ReLU
  - Logistic
  - Softmax
- Loss Function
  - Quadratic Loss
  - Cross Entropy Loss
- Optimizer
  - Gradient Descent
  - Genetic Algorithm

Please feel free to leave comments, trouble-shootings or advices (which are very valuable for me).
