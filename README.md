# Yisy AI Framework



Welcome to my AI Framework project. I am new to ML/DL and I want to learn step by step how frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch work, by developing this project. That also means, this framework is not supposed to have a high efficiency like other professional frameworks. All of these are just for learning and fun. 



Current version **0.1.1** 

Environment: Python 3.7, NumPy 1.18.5 

Features: 


- Network
  - Sequential
- Layer
  - Dense
- Activation Function
  - ReLU
  - Sigmoid
  - Softmax
  - tanh
- Loss Function
  - Quadratic Loss
  - Cross Entropy Loss
- Optimizer
  - Gradient Descent
  - Genetic Algorithm (Experimental)
- Tools
  - Model Management

Please feel free to leave comments, trouble-shootings or advice (which are very valuable for me). 

### Update log
**Update 0.1.1 - 12.05.2020**
- Add tanh as an activation function
- Add model management in tools and can save and load models
- Improve the syntax slightly
- This would be the last Python version of this framework. I am re-programming this project in Julia.
