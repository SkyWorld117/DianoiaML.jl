# Yisy AI Framework



Welcome to my AI Framework project. I am new to ML/DL and I want to learn step by step how frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch work, by developing this project. That also means, this framework is not supposed to have a high efficiency like other professional frameworks. All of these are just for learning and fun. 



Current version **0.1.1**
Environment: Python 3.7, NumPy 1.18.5
Features:
- Network
  - Sequential
- Layer
  - Dense
- Activation Function
  - ReLU
  - Logistic
  - Softmax
- Loss Function
  - Quadratic Loss
  - Cross Entropy Loss
- Optimizer
  - Gradient Descent
  - Genetic Algorithm (Experimental)

Please feel free to leave comments, trouble-shootings or advice (which are very valuable for me). 

### Update log
**Update 0.1.1 - 05.12.2020**
- Add tanh as an activation function
- Improve the syntax slightly
- This is the last Python version of this framework. I am re-programming this project in Julia.
