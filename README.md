# YisyAIFramework

Welcome to my AI Framework project. I am new to ML/DL and I want to learn step by step how frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch work, by developing this project. That also means, this framework is not supposed to have a high efficiency like other professional frameworks (although the current version is ***NOT*** significantly slower than Keras at all). All of these are just for learning and fun. 

The user guide can be found [here](https://github.com/SkyWorld117/YisyAIFramework.jl/wiki/Introduction). Please pay attention to [installation and environment settings](https://github.com/SkyWorld117/YisyAIFramework.jl/wiki/Introduction#installation-and-environment-settings). 

If you are interested in the [history](https://github.com/SkyWorld117/YisyAIFramework.jl/tree/history) versions, you can also check the [update log](https://github.com/SkyWorld117/YisyAIFramework.jl/blob/master/UPDATES.md).
